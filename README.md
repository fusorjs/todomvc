# @fusorjs/todomvc

This is a simple `Todo` list application.

**[Demo Application Website](https://fusorjs.github.io/todomvc/)**

This is an implementation of [TodoMVC specification](http://todomvc.com/) using [@fusorjs front-end library](https://github.com/fusorjs/dom).

## Todo

- combine in array `[list, panel]` in `App.ts` when it will be supported by the `@fusorjs/dom`

## Done

- @efusor to @fusorjs
- total refactor, simplify, use modules
- migrate to typescript
